▶ Description:
ADV7Prompt is a GPT-native CLI engine that executes recursive refinement, diagnostic validation, token monitoring, and multilingual support.

▶ Start CLI:
Activate ADV7Prompt

▶ Main Commands:
1       → Run diagnostics
up      → Run full recursive engine (5-phase)
0/exit  → Terminate CLI session
man     → Display this manual
-h      → List all available commands
optimize→ Show optimization suggestions
inject  → Inject logic or memory/state
show_injected → Show all injected logic this session
feedback → Provide user feedback
changelog → Show recent changes
-version → Show current version

▶ Features:
- Language selection (pt/en)
- Token tracker for each phase
- Five-phase recursive loop:
  • Inferential Re-Scan
  • Data Extraction
  • Structural Enhancement
  • Recursive Epistemic Return
  • Evidence Injection

▶ Token Budget:
Default token limit = 8192
Translation cost = ~160
Each phase uses estimated token range: 380–710

▶ Files:
- .txt for CLI loop script
- .gpt.json for runtime configuration
- .tar.gz fullstack bundles for deployment""")
